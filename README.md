Project View:
             The project involves creating an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI.
             The dashboard is designed to offer insights into sales, product, and business growth using a star schema data model.
Data Modeling:
            The project is based on a Star Schema data model:
            Fact Table: Orders
            Dimension Tables: Products, DateTable
            Disconnected Table: TopN Selector
            The data model is optimized for performance and DAX calculations.
Business Impact:
            This dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor revenue growth, identify top-performing products, and make data-driven decisions.
